Deployment Phase:


Deploy infrastructure using each tool
Monitor deployment time and resource utilization
Collect CloudWatch metrics
Clean up resources after testing


Performance Phase:


Run load tests against deployed infrastructure
Test with different user loads
Measure response times and error rates
Generate performance metrics


Cost Analysis Phase:


Use Infracost for Terraform/OpenTofu
Use AWS Pricing API for CloudFormation
Generate comprehensive cost reports
Include operational costs


Report Generation:


Collect all test results
Generate comparative analysis
Create visualizations
